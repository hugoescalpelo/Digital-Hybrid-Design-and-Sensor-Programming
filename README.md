# Digital Hybrid Design and Sensor Programming
 Circuits, sensors programming and 3D printed Parts

**Digital Hybrid**

*Digital Hybrid* is a project from [Anni Garza Lau](http://www.annigarzalau.com/ "Anni Garza Lau") as part of [ACT](http://https://www.artecienciaytecnologias.mx/ "ACT") (Art, Cience and Technology Grant from Secretaria de Cultura, Mexico). This project is a collaboration between Anni Garza Lau, [Vladimir S치nchez Garrido](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vladimirsaga/ "Vladimir Sanches Garrido"), [Eddie Casta침eda](https://2-2-0.online/ "Eddie Casta침eda"), [Mariel Paredes](https://www.instagram.com/marielfashionfit/ "Mariel Paredes") y [Hugo Escalpelo](http://hugoescalpelo.com "Hugo Escalpelo").

*Digital Hybrid* is an art and technology composed of a suit full of sensors and an artificial intelligence with its own personality. The sensors report the vital signs of their user and information about the environment in which they are. This information influences the behavior and vital signs of artificial intelligence, which is programmed to survive and feel pleasure and pain. Under Reinforcement Learning rules, artificial intelligence interacts with social networks and the contextual information at its disposal, sending sound messages, text and stimuli to the user to transform their behavior in their favor, however, it is expected that this behavior will become a win-win interaction.
